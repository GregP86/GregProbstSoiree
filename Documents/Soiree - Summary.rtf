\f0\fs24 \cf0 Soir\'e9e is a mobile application for digitally collecting, logging and presenting user-submitted data for user- created events. The app allows users to create \'93events\'94 that can be associated with a single location, multiple locations, or no location at all. Once the event is created, individuals can log pictures, video and messages to the event in three ways: (1) Through a copy of the app itself on their personal device, (2) through social media using specific hashtags, and (3) through a logging mode within the app on a publicly placed device at the actual event. The app would then take this information and present it in a visually appealing manner which could be updated in real time.}
